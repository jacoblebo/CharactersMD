```A letter and a jar would make it's way to Sunset-Scales, not too long after the end of the Auridon Jester's Festival.  The jar itself is heavily bound with ropes. If jostled too much, hissing sounds would eminate from inside. There are holes in the lid used to seal the jar- but they're fairly small.

The letter would be penned in Jel, the blockly script hand-drawn.

Friend 'Sunset-Scales'

I find my frills full of hope for your waters to be clear and the sun to shine warmly on your scales. My claws were busy with finding an altmer that would give me a pot while my claws were full of snakes! It seems that many there are scared of them- but they are good food! It rubs my spines wrong, that they might not understand. But- after giving gold discs to one who was walking the street to obtain a pot, I put the snakes inside! Three- scales are very blue! Like the bright flowers after a cold dawn.

I hope our currents bring us together once more, 'Sunset' friend, during times of calm water and quiet hearts. It always brings out the happy feelings and thoughts of being in the home-mud.

```Contained inside the jar would be three Summerset sea snakes- quite angry at being couriered around.
