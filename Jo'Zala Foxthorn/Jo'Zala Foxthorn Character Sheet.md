**Gender/Sex:** Nonbinary

**Orientation:** Pansexual Demiromantic

**Occupation:** Magickal Researcher/Enchanter - Zala delves into the magickal world to figure out why and how things work so they can broaden their own knowledge, and apply it to their other occupation, enchanting, the art and skill of turning mundane items magickal by imbuing them with properties.

**Relations:** His entire family is still alive, and they try to  stay in contact with them when able to. In addition to this, they are good friends with his mentor, Jo'Pijon, who they look up to highly, as well as a few friends from the Mage's Guild in Rimmen.

**Origins:** Near S'ren-ja, Anequina, Elsweyr

**Biography:** A khajiit born of farmers in/near S'ren-ja, Zala is used to labor, but always had the knack of learning a bit quicker than other people their age. Not far into adolescence, his family sent him to Dune on enough money pooled together to learn under one of the scholars there, where they received a somewhat formal education on subjects like history, rudiments of Magic, and some amount of other cultures, but they also learned how to act. After he became of age, he traveled to Rimmen with the assistance of that same scholar to continue his education at the Mage's Guild- taking on tasks provided to him there to pay for it, be it working in the library, scribing down results of an experiment, or just cleaning up around the guild,

His two primary areas of study became Illusion, as well as enchanting, where he began work on a dream project that will likely never work, a mask someone could wear to make them look like anything they wanted to (given they knew how to enchant). It's more of a fools errand than anything, but through his attachment to this mask idea, and studying at the Mage's Guild, he has learned a lot.

However-endless research into a topic is always expensive, and Joâ€˜Zala always needs gold, so they're looking for something that feels a bit more like home that would have use for his ability to enchant or use spells, or just another pair of hands, in return for a place to stay and work.

**Personality:** Zala keeps themselves well kept at all times, trying to remain in everyone's good graces while also staying a bit under the radar. Not exactly wanting to be the constant center of attention, more just keep their name known and to be known as a freindly person.

**Appearance:** Zala is a slender, relatively adrogynous looking 

**RP Hooks:** 

* Enchantment Request
	* As a mage and scholar, Zala knows how to enchant mundane items, recharge depleted enchantments, and how to identify unknown enchantments. They are more than happy to do this for free for friends, or for some amount of gold for new faces. This can be done anywhere your character might want, but there would need to be an enchanting set-up.
* Note Swap
	* Zala is a scholar, it's how they got the 'Jo' honorific after all, so sharing knowledge on one of the many topics they were taught or taught themselves is something that Zala always keeps an ear and notebook ready for. This can be done anywhere from a tavern talking about the difference in "Ki" and "Ka" runes, to a high profile dress up event between academics.
* Helping Hand
	* Need help from someone skilled in Magics? Stranded on the side of the road and unable to get a spoke to fit into a hole? Zala does sometimes travel away from their dwellings in order to learn, get materials, or simply travel from place to for leisure. They are happy to help anyone that might need him.
* Oops! All Magicka
	* Zala sometimes makes mistakes in their research into Illusion and Alteration, even if all their experiments are done in a "safe and controlled" manner away from others, your character might stumble upon Zala in some fairly questionable circumstances. Halfway up the tree with the ground underneath it glowing bright green? It has happened. If you're going with this hook, understand that Zala is a good, lawful character.
* Invited
	* If your character is notable for their illusion skills, or is simply friendly, Zala may've reached out to have tea or share a meal at some point with yours. The pilot has a letter template they are itching to use.
