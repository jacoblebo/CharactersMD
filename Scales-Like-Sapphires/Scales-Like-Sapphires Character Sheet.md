**Origins:** Soulrest, Black Marsh

**Biography:** Scales-With-Sapphires was hatched to a very peaceful and prosperous surrounding in Soulrest, with little strife to be noted in her personal life as a child. Endlessly curious, she would always ask questions and seek information from visitors and the elders of Soulrest. She has a good connection to the Hist, a force in her life she respects greatly as bringing peace and purpose to her life and the lives of the Saxhleel around her. Soulrest was always fairly quiet as a trading town, and Sapphires always had dreams to see beyond where she was raised, and the Hist seemed to agree. She used her ability to recall information and her personality to her benefit to become an appraiser, at first doing it for free in exchange for lodging and food, but turned it into a career later down the line.

**Personality:** Sapphires attempts to present herself as very ordered and structured. She has a strong sense of ethics, and a robust moral code, seeking equity in all things and an understanding in everything else. She is extremely friendly, and always happy to help anyone with good intentions she comes across.

**RP Hooks:** There are two main categories for these: In Black Marsh, and Outside of Black Marsh

* In Black Marsh:
	* Tribe Visit
		* As an appraiser, Sapphires travels the Marsh in order to use her skills to facilitate trade. Maybe it's fish from one tribe for baskets from another, maybe it's a tribe getting their goods valued before travelling to a trading hub in order to know if it will be profitable. Maybe she's visiting to learn more about the Tribe to network for them, even.
		* As an Saxhleel, Sapphires seeks the wisdom from elders, priests, leaders, and other Saxhleel. She may've taken a detour simply to learn about something new, or for the wisdom of someone skilled. She may also simply be paying a social visit to a friend.
	* Lilmoth Run-in
		* Sapphires spends a fair bit of time in Lilmoth, her most personal place of residence   being a mudhut nearby. If your character is a fellow resident or visiting the area, you may run into her there, getting food, in the market, what be it.
	* Invitations
		* Sapphires will reply to most any invitation from a person she doesn't know asking for the help of an appraiser. Eager and happy to do her work, after a short letter conversation, you too can have this blue argonian whereever you need her.

* Outside Black Marsh
	* Invitations
		* Sapphires will reply to most any invitation from a person she doesn't know asking for the help of an appraiser. Eager and happy to do her work, after a short letter conversation, you too can have this blue argonian whereever you need her, after transit time is taken into account.
		* If your character has met Sapphires before and the interaction went well, she will also be happy to attempt to visit them whereever in Tamriel they might be, utilizing a portal from the Mage's Guild in Leyawiin to get into the area. Might be a bit expensive, but she enjoys spending time with friends.
	* Leyawiin/Rimmen/Gideon Run-in
		* Sapphires spends some time in these places of civilization, in addtion to her time spent deeper in the marsh. Often more for networking, pleasure, and education than her job as an appraiser, she is happy to interact with anyone doing the same.

**Appearance:** _(Description or Image)_ A blue scaled argonian, with two distinct kinds of scales- very small ones aswell as larger ones. These smaller scales give her more flexability and a softer appearance, but make her feel a bit bumpy. The largely scales are slightly reflective, like a fish's scales, returning an almost gem like quality, the source of her name. She has spines and gills along her neck, a bit hidden, as well as fins along the top of her head, blue as well. Her eyes are not quite blue, and not quite green, somewhere closer to blue.
